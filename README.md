This Git repo contains the supporting MNIST datasets/images and Jupyter Notebook for the Medium series where I introduce three different ways to perform machine learning on GCP. 

In this medium series, I have trained and evaluated a classification model on the MNIST dataset using the following ML options offered by GCP. I later used the trained model to correctly predict the handwritten digits on the MNIST test dataset.Â Hope you like it!

* AutoML Vision 
* Custom Model using Keras
